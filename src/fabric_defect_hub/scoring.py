"""Combine a leaderboard row's accuracy ("technical") and runtime-cost
("overhead") metrics into one ranked score.

`benchmark.py`'s `leaderboard()` already sorts by a single raw metric name
-- useful when you know exactly which number matters, but it can't answer
"which model is the best overall trade-off" when technical metrics
(AUROC, mAP, mIoU, ...) and overhead metrics (FPS, latency, memory, model
size) pull in different directions. This module is that combination step,
used by the Gradio Benchmark tab (`web/benchmark.py`) so its leaderboard can
rank on a configurable blend of the two instead of forcing a pick of one
column.

Metric names are classified by pattern rather than a fixed enumeration --
new evaluators/profilers add metric names over time (see `evaluation/*.py`,
`profiling/base.py::summarize_latencies`), and a name this module doesn't
recognize should just be excluded from scoring, not require this file to be
updated in lockstep or raise on an unfamiliar key.
