"""The one place that says which table a metric belongs in.

Two top-level parts, and the split is not cosmetic — they answer different
questions and are read by different people:

* **technical** — how well the model detects, broken out by the granularity
  of the ground truth it was scored against: `image_level` (is this image
  defective), `pixel_level` (which pixels), `instance_level` (which defect,
  as a box), plus `cross_domain` (does any of it survive an unseen fabric).
* **overhead** — what running it costs: `compute`, `memory`, and
  `communication`.

`communication` is declared here and reports `not_implemented`. It covers
event-vs-continuous bandwidth saving, which only means something once there
is a distributed deployment to measure it on. Declaring it empty rather than
omitting it is deliberate: a reader comparing this against the project's
metric plan can see the row exists and is unbuilt, instead of wondering
whether it was measured and lost.

Everything downstream — the JSONL reader, the Gradio tables, any LaTeX
export — reads its grouping from here. That is the point: the web layer used
to decide its own columns, which is how a metric could be measured and then
never shown, or shown under a heading that disagreed with the report.

This module is pure: it maps names to groups and reshapes rows. It measures
nothing and imports no framework, so `import fabric_defect_hub` stays cheap
and a front end can ask "what tables exist" without a backend installed.
