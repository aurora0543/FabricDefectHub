"""Backend glue for the Benchmark tab: pick a dataset shot regime
(full-shot = every test sample, few-shot = ~350 samples, matching
`single_image.SHOT_FULL`/`SHOT_FEW`) and one or more trained models, then
run each one through `loader.run_experiment` with the task-appropriate
`Evaluator` (`AnomalyEvaluator` for image AUROC/F1, `DetectionEvaluator` for
mAP/precision/recall, `SegmentationEvaluator` for mIoU/Dice/pixel-F1) to
build a leaderboard.

Every selected model is cycled through the same mount -> test -> unmount ->
next-model pipeline (`run_benchmark`'s loop): one model is loaded, evaluated,
then explicitly released (`_release_model`) before the next one is
instantiated, so a full run of all `CANONICAL_MODELS` — several hundred MB to
~1GB of weights each — never holds more than one resident model in memory at
a time. `run_benchmark` is a generator that yields after every model so the
UI can render results as they land instead of blocking until the whole
leaderboard is done.

No heatmaps or bounding boxes are rendered here — anomaly-map-producing
adapters (anomalib, Dinomaly) are called without `output_dir`, so only
image-level metrics are computed and nothing is written to disk; this tab
only ever needs numbers, not images.

Two opt-in additions on top of the accuracy-only leaderboard above:

- `include_profiling=True` runs each model through a `PyTorchProfiler` pass
  too (export to TorchScript, then measure FPS/latency/memory the same way
  `benchmark.py`'s YAML `profile:` block does for the CLI path) so the
  leaderboard also carries overhead metrics, not just accuracy. Off by
  default because it roughly doubles per-model time (export + N warmup/
  measured forward passes) — the UI's own warmup/measured-run counts are
  intentionally lower than the CLI default (`ProfileConfig`'s 10/100) to
  stay responsive for an interactive click. When it's on, `_flops_and_lmei`
  also instruments the adapter's live model (`ModelAdapter.raw_module()` --
  a frozen TorchScript export can't accept the hooks FLOPs counting needs)
  for FLOPs (`profiling.flops.compute_model_flops`), parameter count, and
  the combined LMEI edge-deployment score (`evaluation.lmei_profiler
  .calculate_lmei`) — best-effort, so a missing `thop` install just
  forfeits those three
  columns rather than the whole row.
- `include_resolution_sweep=True` exports once, then profiles that same
  export at a handful of input resolutions (`RESOLUTION_SWEEP_SIZES`) to
  fit a throughput-vs-resolution decay slope (`profiling.scaling
  .throughput_resolution_slope`) — a cheaper add-on than re-running
  `include_profiling` per resolution, since only the profiling forward
  pass (not accuracy evaluation) varies by input size.
- `cross_domain_dataset_label`, if given, evaluates the same loaded model
  against a second ("target") dataset — no slicing, whole dataset — right
  after its primary ("source") evaluation, and reports the accuracy drop
  via `evaluation.cross_domain.cross_domain_degradation` on whichever
  metric each task treats as primary (`_PRIMARY_ACCURACY_METRIC`). Rows
  whose task the target dataset can't supply, or whose source accuracy is
  zero, simply omit the degradation column rather than failing the row.
- Every run always appends to `run_log_path` (default `runs/leaderboard_log.jsonl`)
  via `reporting.append_run_log`, so leaderboard runs triggered from the UI
  leave the same durable trace `fdh benchmark` runs already did — this is
  what the "Run History" tab reads back.

`score_preset`/`custom_technical_weight` blend the accumulated rows'
technical (accuracy) and overhead (cost) metrics into one ranked
`composite_score` via `scoring.score_rows` — recomputed after every model
finishes so the ranking updates live as the leaderboard fills in.
