"""Cross-run analysis over a resolution sweep or a concurrency sweep --
distinct from `profiling/base.py`'s single-run summary, since these
metrics only make sense across *multiple* profiling runs:

* throughput-vs-resolution decay slope (least-squares beta), and the
  slope difference between two groups (e.g. two backends/precisions/
  devices) with a bootstrap CI, so "how much worse does resolution scaling
  get" has a number and an uncertainty, not just two separate slopes eyeballed
  side by side.
* the largest concurrent stream count that still fits a hard real-time
  frame budget (e.g. 33ms for 30fps).
