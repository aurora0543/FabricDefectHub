"""One entry point that measures every implemented metric over every model
that actually has weights, and writes the results as JSONL.

The problem this solves is not that the individual metrics were missing —
accuracy lives behind `fdh evaluate`, runtime behind `fdh benchmark`, the
resolution slope behind the Gradio tab, and `max_concurrent_streams` behind
nothing at all. It is that measuring "all of them, for everything trained so
far" meant driving four different front ends by hand and reconciling their
output formats afterwards.

Design rules, all of them consequences of "this runs unattended after a long
training batch":

* **Nothing raises.** A model whose backend is not installed, whose weights
  vanished, or whose export blows up produces a row with `status` of
  `skipped`/`failed` and a reason. One broken model must not cost the other
  seventeen their measurements.
* **Rows are written as they finish**, not at the end, so a sweep killed by
  a disconnected SSH session still leaves everything measured up to that
  point.
* **Discovery is from the weight manifest**, so "models that have been
  trained" is read from provenance rather than guessed from a hard-coded
  list that would drift.
* **One row per (model, metric group).** A flat table would force every
  group's columns onto every model; separate rows let a reader load the
  JSONL and pivot on whichever group they care about.

The output is deliberately JSONL rather than a report: this is the input to
whatever table, plot, or LaTeX export comes next, and `reporting/` already
owns turning rows into a document.
