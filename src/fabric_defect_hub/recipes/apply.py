"""Wiring that makes a config profile *actually take effect* during a run,
rather than only being printed by `fdh list-recipes`.

Before this module the `recipes/*.py` classes were resolvable
(`get_recipe`) and self-describing (`get_recipe_summary`) but nothing ever
called `adapt_architecture` / `configure_loss` / `get_default_hyperparameters`
on the train/predict path — the recipe was documentation, not behaviour.

Here a recipe influences a run in three concrete, inspectable ways:

  * architecture  — `adapt_architecture` is invoked on the adapter's live
    module *if one is already materialised* (guarded via ``__dict__`` so we
    never force a lazy backend to load weights just to look at it).
  * loss          — the configured criterion is attached as ``_recipe_loss``
    for backends that consume a custom loss.
  * hyperparameters — resolved once and attached as ``_recipe_hparams`` so a
    backend can fold the trainer-relevant subset into its own trainer.

`load_model(..., recipe=...)` calls `attach_recipe`; `run_experiment` calls
`apply_recipe_to_training` immediately before `model.train`.

Deliberately *not* done here: flattening every recipe hyperparameter into the
backend's ``train(**kwargs)``. Recipe hyperparameter dicts mix trainer args
(``lr0``) with architecture/aug flags (``spd_conv_downsample``) and use names
that don't always match a backend's trainer (YOLO wants ``box``, the recipe
says ``box_loss_weight``). Blindly forwarding them would crash a real trainer,
so each backend opts in to the keys it understands via
`recipe_trainer_overrides` (see `UltralyticsAdapter.train`).
