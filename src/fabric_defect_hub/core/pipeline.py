"""BasePipeline: the one config-driven run lifecycle, shared by every backend.

Each backend used to carry its own `run_from_config` and its own
`XxxRunResult` dataclass — six copies of the same eight steps (validate, build
adapter, resolve data, train, register, evaluate, export, return), differing
only in how each step is spelled. Six copies means a fix to the lifecycle has
to be made six times, and the drift is invisible until someone diffs them: the
`elif model.weights: load_trained_model(...)` branch, for instance, existed in
two of the six and was simply missing from the rest.

Here the *order* is written once and the *differences* are hooks:

    validate -> build_adapter -> prepare -> train+register -> evaluate -> export

A backend subclasses `BasePipeline` and fills in three required hooks
(`build_adapter`, `build_train_config`, `evaluate`) plus whatever optional
ones it needs. Anomaly backends get `AnomalyPipeline`, which implements
`evaluate` as predict + `AnomalyEvaluator` — the four one-class/zero-shot
backends had that identical block copied four times.

The `run_from_config` / `run_from_yaml` module functions each backend exports
stay exactly as they were; they are now three lines around a pipeline class.
