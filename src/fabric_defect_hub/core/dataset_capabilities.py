"""Single source of truth for what each registered dataset may be used for.

Before this module, "what can dataset X train/evaluate?" was answered by
several independently-maintained structures scattered across the project --
`training.ANOMALY_TRAINABLE_DATASETS`, `training.ZERO_SHOT_TRAINABLE_DATASETS`,
`training.DEFAULT_DATASET_ROOTS`, `datasets/fabric_train.py`'s hardcoded
`_MEMBERS` tuple, and `web/single_image.py`'s `DATASET_CATALOG`. Adding a
dataset meant remembering to touch all of them (and nothing enforced that
you had); getting one wrong silently mis-scoped what a model could train on.

This module replaces the *decision* structures (not the on-disk parsing
metadata `DATASET_CATALOG` still owns, like env var names and UI slice
dropdowns) with one declaration per dataset: `register_capabilities(name,
default_root=..., roles={...}, tasks=(...))`. `training.py` and
`datasets/fabric_train.py` now *derive* their sets from this registry
instead of hand-maintaining parallel copies, so declaring a new dataset's
capabilities here is enough to make it a training-eligible source, a
`fabric-train` member, or both.

Roles (a dataset may hold more than one):
- "anomaly_train"       -- in-domain fabric, valid standalone training
                           source for the one-class anomaly backends
                           (Anomalib/Dinomaly/MambaAD) and MoECLIP's
                           evaluation target.
- "zero_shot_train"      -- cross-domain auxiliary corpus MoECLIP (the
                           zero-shot backend) may train on; disjoint from
                           "anomaly_train" by design -- training a
                           zero-shot detector on the same fabric it is
                           later evaluated on would void the zero-shot
                           claim (see `training._enforce_trainable_dataset`).
- "detection_train"      -- bbox-labelled, a legitimate source for the
                           Ultralytics/torchvision detection backends.
- "fabric_train_member"  -- contributes samples to the `fabric-train`
                           composite (datasets/fabric_train.py); implies the
                           dataset exposes normal/defect images the same
                           way every other fabric adapter does.

A dataset with none of these roles (e.g. a composite like `fabric-train`
itself, which doesn't nest into its own union) is eval-only / non-training
by omission -- there is no separate "eval_only" tag, it's just the absence
of "anomaly_train"/"zero_shot_train"/"detection_train".
