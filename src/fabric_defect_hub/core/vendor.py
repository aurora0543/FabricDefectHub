"""Importing vendored research code without letting it into the process.

Research repos are not packages. Dinomaly and MoECLIP both ship flat
top-level modules meant to be run from their own repo root — `utils`,
`dataset`, `models`/`model`, `optimizers`, `forward_utils` — with no package
prefix and no pip release. The obvious way to use them is to put the checkout
on `sys.path` and `import utils`, and that is exactly what breaks: the two
repos define *different* modules under the same generic names, the Benchmark
tab runs every canonical model back to back in one process (`web/benchmark.py`),
and whichever backend imported first would win while the second silently got
the other repo's code. Adding a third vendored repo makes a collision close to
certain.

`VendoredRepo` imports a checkout inside a window where its root is
`sys.path[0]` and any already-imported module owning one of its names is
temporarily displaced, then *takes the imported modules back out* of
`sys.modules` and keeps them in a private cache, restoring what was there
before. The module objects keep working afterwards — their cross-references
were resolved into module globals at import time — but they no longer occupy
the shared names, and `sys.path` is left exactly as it was found.

The one assumption: vendored code must not import its own top-level names
lazily from inside a function body, since by then the name is gone from
`sys.modules`. Verified against both pinned checkouts (Dinomaly's only such
imports are in `dinov2/run/*`, DINOv2's SLURM job launchers, which nothing
here touches).

Only a backend's `vendor.py` may name upstream modules. Everything else goes
through the mapping this returns, which is what
`tests/test_vendor_boundary.py` enforces.
