"""`DatasetAdapter` for the "Fabric Defects Dataset", a fabric-texture defect
dataset laid out as flat class folders one level below the linked root:
`Fabric Defect Dataset/defect free/` (normal) plus `hole/`, `Vertical/`,
`horizontal/`, `lines/`, `stain/` (defect types). No author-provided
train/test split, so this reuses `FlatFolderAnomalyDataset`'s synthesized,
leak-free split.

Unlike TILDA-400, this dataset is **not** purely image-level: the `hole`,
`Vertical`, and `horizontal` defect folders additionally ship binary
segmentation masks named `<stem>_processed (<n>).<ext>` alongside each base
photo `<stem>.<ext>` (`lines`/`stain` have no masks at all). These are NOT
independent defect photos — visually they are black frames with small white
speckle regions marking the defect location, and there can be 1-3 per base
image (multiple annotated regions/passes). This adapter therefore:

1. Excludes every `_processed (<n>)` file from the image pool so it is never
   counted as its own `Sample`.
2. Attaches the first (sorted) mask to its base image's
   `Annotations.anomaly_mask`, and — when `task="segmentation"` — all of them
   to `Annotations.masks`.

In-domain fabric, so it is a *training-eligible* source (see
`training.ANOMALY_TRAINABLE_DATASETS` and the `fabric-train` composite), and
also usable on its own for anomaly evaluation (image-level everywhere,
pixel-level where a mask exists).
