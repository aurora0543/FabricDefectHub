"""`fabric-train` -- a *composite* dataset that unions the in-domain fabric
datasets into a single training corpus.

This is the mechanism behind the project's training policy (see
`training.ANOMALY_TRAINABLE_DATASETS`): anomaly models should train on more
than one fabric dataset, but not on arbitrary/cross-domain ones. Rather than
change every backend's single-`dataset` config schema, `fabric-train` is
itself a registered `DatasetAdapter` whose `load_samples()` concatenates its
members' samples -- so `data.dataset: fabric-train` flows through the
existing one-dataset pipeline unchanged.

Members (each a fabric, in-domain anomaly source) are every dataset declared
with the "fabric_train_member" role in `core.dataset_capabilities` (ZJU-Leaper,
RAW_FABRID, TILDA-400, Fabric Defects Dataset, Tianchi as of this writing) --
adding a new fabric dataset's capability declaration is enough to fold it
into this union, no edit needed here. Each member is resolved through the
same registry the loader uses, with a root of `<root>/<member subdir>`
(default `root` is the project's `data/` directory).

Selection semantics match the other adapters, applied to the *union*:
`num_samples` is the global total across all members (None = everything);
`use_defect`/`defect_ratio` control the normal/defect mix globally;
`split`/`task`/`seed` are forwarded to every member. Member-specific knobs
(ZJU-Leaper's `pattern`, ...) are intentionally not exposed here -- the whole
point is to draw from every texture/source at once.
