"""Backbone presets and upstream's training defaults for MambaAD, mirrored
from the paper's published MVTec-AD recipe (`configs/mambaad/mambaad_mvtec.py`
in the upstream repo) rather than reimplemented from scratch -- see
`adapter.py`'s module docstring for why this is a clean-room reimplementation
rather than a vendored `components/mambaad` (as originally attempted; see
`components/README.md`'s git history) in the first place.

Like Dinomaly, MambaAD is one architecture (frozen CNN teacher + fused
embedding + Mamba decoder), not a model zoo -- the "backbone" choice is
which `timm` teacher to freeze, not a family of unrelated models.

# published 98.6 mAUROC is that single model's average, not a per-category

# per-category zoo lacks, so it is worth preserving rather than quietly
# collapsing to per-category training: point it at the `fabric-train`
# composite (which unions every fabric source, see

# overrides in training.py) is driven by an iteration budget, so
