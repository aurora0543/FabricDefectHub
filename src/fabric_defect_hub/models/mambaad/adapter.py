"""`ModelAdapter` implementation for MambaAD -- a **clean-room
reimplementation**, not a vendored `components/mambaad` checkout.

A vendored submodule was tried once already (see `components/README.md`'s
git history: "remove infeasible MambaAD"). The reasons hold for the
official repo (`lewandofskee/MambaAD`) too, not just the fork that was
tried:

* Its `model/`/`trainer/` files are not a runnable project on their own --
  `model/mambaad.py` imports `from model import get_model, MODEL` and
  `trainer/mambaad_trainer.py` imports `util.*`/`data.get_loader`/
  `optim.*`/`loss.*`/`trainer._base_trainer.BaseTrainer`, none of which
  exist in that repo. Its own README says as much: "Clone this repo to
  [ADer]" -- it is a plugin dropped into an ADer checkout, not a
  self-contained project the way Dinomaly and MoECLIP each are. Vendoring
  it would mean vendoring ADer too, a second, general-purpose framework,
  which no other entry under `components/` does.
* Its selective-scan core calls `mamba_ssm.ops.selective_scan_interface
  .selective_scan_fn`, a compiled CUDA kernel. `pip install mamba_ssm`
  needs a matching CUDA/nvcc toolchain to build at all -- it does not
  install on this project's dev machine (Apple Silicon, no CUDA), so
  depending on the real package would gate this backend to a CUDA host
  exactly as hard as vendoring it would have.

This module reimplements the architecture instead: `ssm.py`/`scan.py` port
the selective-scan recurrence and its five multi-directional scan orders
in portable PyTorch/NumPy; `decoder.py`/`network.py` port the LSS/HSS
decoder and the teacher-fusion-decoder wiring. What's reused directly is
the published recipe's *values* (`presets.py`, sourced from upstream's own
`configs/mambaad/mambaad_mvtec.py`), not its code. Note this does *not*
mean `mamba_ssm` goes unused when it is available: `ssm.py` dispatches to
its fused kernel at run time on CUDA, so a training host that has it gets
upstream's exact kernel, while every other machine still runs.

**Fidelity, verified against upstream source rather than assumed:**

* Training loss is `L2Loss` = MSE, not the cosine objective the rest of
  this family uses (ADer `loss/base_loss.py`; see `_reconstruction_loss`).
* The anomaly map is per-level `1 - cosine`, upsampled, summed, divided by
  `len(levels) * sum(weights)`, then Gaussian-blurred at sigma 4 with
  scipy's kernel width *and* boundary convention (ADer `util/metric.py::
  cal_anomaly_map`; see `_anomaly_map`/`_gaussian_blur`).
* Image score is the max over the anomaly map (`pr_sp_max` in ADer's
  evaluator).
* The LR schedule is upstream's warmup + step decay (see `train`).
* MambaAD is **multi-class unified** -- one model over all categories at
  once (see `presets.DEFAULT_TRAIN_KWARGS`).

**Known remaining gaps** (honest scope, not silently glossed):

* No end-to-end accuracy validation against the published numbers. Doing
  that means a real multi-class MVTec-AD run on a CUDA host at upstream's
  full budget; nothing here has been checked to land at 98.6 mAUROC.
* `total_iters` defaults to this project's convention, not upstream's
  1000-epoch budget (see `presets.py`).
* Upstream's optional mixup/AMP/EMA and distributed training are not
  ported; they are ADer trainer infrastructure rather than MambaAD itself,
  and its published config leaves mixup's probability at 0.

Architecturally this is the same "reverse distillation" family as
`models/dinomaly/adapter.py`'s `ViTill`: frozen pretrained encoder,
trainable decoder, multi-scale feature reconstruction, anomaly score from
encoder/decoder discrepancy. Key differences from Dinomaly: MambaAD's
encoder is a plain CNN (`timm` `features_only`), not a ViT; its decoder is
Mamba-based (`MambaUPNet`) rather than a linear-attention transformer; and
it trains on MSE rather than cosine distance.
