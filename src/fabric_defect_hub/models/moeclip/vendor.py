"""The vendored `components/moeclip` checkout, imported in isolation.

MoECLIP ships as flat top-level modules meant to be run from its own repo root
-- `utils`, `dataset`, `model`, `forward_utils` -- with no package prefix and
no pip release. Those names collide with Dinomaly's (`utils`, `dataset`), and
the Benchmark tab runs every canonical model back to back in one process (see
`web/benchmark.py`), so neither repo may be left occupying them.

`core.vendor.VendoredRepo` handles that; see it for the mechanism and its one
assumption. This file is the only place in the project allowed to name
MoECLIP's upstream modules.

MoECLIP also hardcodes `torch.device("cuda:0")` when allocating its LoRA
expert weights (`model/moe_adapter.py::SimpleLoraExpert.__init__`), which
makes the model unconstructable on any CPU/MPS machine. Until that is patched
on the fork (the proper fix -- see `components/README.md`),
`cuda_free_module_init()` supplies a scoped compatibility shim.

    machine without CUDA -- including this project's dev laptop and CI.

    The subclass is transparent to `isinstance`, `state_dict()` keys and
