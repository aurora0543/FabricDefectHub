"""`ModelAdapter` implementation wrapping the vendored `components/moeclip`
checkout (see `components/README.md` and `vendor.py`).

Like Dinomaly, MoECLIP ships as research scripts rather than a library:
`train.py`/`test.py` are argparse mains that read `.jsonl` metadata files
for datasets they hardcode, write their own logs, and print a pandas
leaderboard. This adapter re-implements those two loops -- upstream's
`train.py::train_adapter` and `test.py::get_predictions` -- against this
project's `Sample`/`Prediction`/`Artifact` contracts, importing only the
vendored `nn.Module`s and the scoring/loss helpers in `forward_utils`, so
the math stays upstream's.

Two things differ from Dinomaly's adapter, both forced by what MoECLIP is:

* **Training is not one-class, and not on fabric.** MoECLIP is a
  *zero-shot* anomaly detector: it learns prompt-aligned patch
  representations from labelled anomalies (image label + pixel mask) on an
  auxiliary corpus and is then applied to categories it has never seen. So
  its train split needs defective samples *with masks*, not normal-only
  data (the opposite of PatchCore/Dinomaly -- see `_select_train_samples`),
  and that corpus is a cross-domain object benchmark (VisA / MVTec AD /
  LOCO), not this project's fabric sets. Training it on fabric would make
  its fabric numbers in-domain and void the transfer claim; `fdh train`
  rejects it (`training.ZERO_SHOT_TRAINABLE_DATASETS`), and the evaluation
  target is a separate config key (`data.test_dataset`).
* **Only the adapters are trained.** The CLIP backbone stays frozen;
  checkpoints hold just `text_adapter` + `image_adapter` (which contains
  the MoE LoRA experts, the segmentation projections and the detection
  projection), matching upstream's `save_checkpoint`. They are plain
  `state_dict`s saved with `torch.save`, so -- as with Dinomaly, unlike
  anomalib's Lightning checkpoints -- there's no untrusted-pickle gate.

    `name` selects the backbone preset; upstream supports exactly one
    (`ViT-L-14-336`, the default) -- see `presets.MODEL_PRESETS`.
    `**kwargs` may override any of `presets.DEFAULT_ARCH_KWARGS`
    (`moe_num_experts`, `moe_layers`, `img_size`, ...); whatever is used is
    recorded in the artifact's metadata so `predict` rebuilds the same
    architecture.

    Two further kwargs configure the *prompts*, which is the only part of
    this backend with no counterpart in the other adapters (see
    `presets.py`'s module docstring):

    * `prompt_class`: pin every sample to one prompt class instead of
      reading it from the sample's dataset metadata. This is the usual
      setting for fabric inference — one texture being inspected, one
      prompt — e.g. `prompt_class="fabric"`.
    * `prompts`: `{class name: description}` overriding the noun phrase
      templated into that class's prompts, e.g.
      `{"fabric": "woven cotton fabric"}`.

    Both are inference-time-tunable on purpose and deliberately *not*
    pinned from the training artifact: MoECLIP is trained on one domain
    (VisA's objects) and applied to another (fabric), so the prompts that
    trained it are not the prompts it should be run with.
