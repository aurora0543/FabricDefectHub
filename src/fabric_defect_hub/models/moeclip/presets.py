"""Backbone presets, upstream training defaults, and the text-prompt
registry for MoECLIP, mirrored from upstream's `train.py`/`test.py`
argparse defaults rather than reinvented.

MoECLIP is one architecture (OpenCLIP ViT-L/14-336 + per-patch LoRA
mixture-of-experts + PAA aggregation), not a model zoo, so -- as with
`models/dinomaly/presets.py` -- there is no alias table, just the backbone
it supports and the knobs that make up its training recipe. The backbone
is genuinely fixed upstream, not merely defaulted: `MoECLIP.__init__`
hardcodes `d_model = 1024` and its `forward` loops over exactly 24
transformer blocks, both ViT-L/14 specifics.

`REAL_NAME_OVERRIDES`/`class_name_for`/`register_class_prompts` cover the
other half of what upstream hardcodes, and are the *only* seam between
this project's data contracts and MoECLIP's prompt machinery: nothing in
`Sample`/`Prediction` grows a prompt field, because a prompt is not
per-image data — it is a property of what is being inspected, resolved
from the sample's dataset metadata and overridable per run via
`model.prompt_class` / `model.prompts` in the config.

MoECLIP is prompt-driven: text embeddings come
from `"a photo of a damaged {real_name}."`-style templates, and upstream
resolves `real_name` through per-dataset `CLASS_NAMES`/`REAL_NAMES` tables
in `dataset/constants.py` keyed by dataset names it ships with (MVTec,
VisA, BTAD, ...). This project feeds it arbitrary `Sample` lists instead,
so the adapter registers its own synthetic dataset key into those same
(mutable, shared-by-reference with `forward_utils`) dicts at run time --
no fork edit, and upstream's prompt machinery is used exactly as written.
