"""Per-algorithm configuration for the anomalib models this project exposes.

We deliberately do not reimplement these algorithms (see the project's
"don't reimplement models we can depend on" principle in the top-level
README) — `anomalib` already ships correct, maintained implementations.
What *is* our responsibility, and what lives here, is:

1. Alias resolution: the README/paper names ("RD4AD", "EfficientAD",
   "SuperSimpleNet") don't match anomalib's class names
   (`ReverseDistillation`, `EfficientAd`, `Supersimplenet`). Callers should
   be able to use either.
2. Fabric-tailored defaults: anomalib's own defaults are tuned for MVTec-AD
   style single-object images at 256x256. `MODEL_PRESETS` below adjusts the
   handful of knobs that matter for fabric texture images (uniform
   background, defects are small/local, and — per `ZJULeaperDataset` — the
   caller can dial in a low-shot or zero-shot sample count), while still
   letting `train_config['model_kwargs']` override anything.

`MODEL_PRESETS` doubles as the registration list: a class is reachable
through this backend only if it has an entry here (see
`resolve_model_class_name` / `list_supported_variants`). An entry whose
values are simply upstream's own defaults is therefore not redundant — it
is how the model is admitted, and the comment above each entry says
explicitly whether anything was tuned for fabric or not. Per this
project's citation rule, a preset only claims a fabric adjustment where
one was actually made and can be justified.

Families covered (so a reader can see the benchmark's breadth at a glance):

  memory bank / statistics  PatchCore, PaDiM
  teacher-student           RD4AD, STFPM, UniNet
  reconstruction            DRAEM, DSR
  adversarial (GAN)         GANomaly
  normalizing flow          FastFlow
  synthetic-anomaly         SuperSimpleNet, GLASS
  zero-shot VLM             WinCLIP, AnomalyDINO
  regularized distillation  EfficientAD

Verified against anomalib 2.5.0 (`pip install -e ".[anomalib]"`); every
class name and every constructor kwarg below was introspected directly
from that installed version with `inspect.signature`, not guessed, and
`tests/test_anomalib_config.py::test_every_preset_key_is_a_real_constructor_kwarg`
re-checks that against the installed anomalib rather than trusting this
note to stay true across upgrades.

    # Two things about this model are unlike every other entry here, and
    # both are load-bearing:
    #
    # 1. `batch_size` is a *constructor* argument, not an engine one, so the
    #    canonical `TrainConfig.batch_size` does NOT reach it (see
    #    `AnomalibAdapter.TRAIN_CONFIG_KEYS`, which maps only genuinely flat
    #    keys). Checked what it actually does in anomalib 2.5.0 rather than
    #    assuming: it sizes two buffers, `real_label`/`fake_label`, and
    #    nothing in `Ganomaly.training_step` reads them -- both loss modules
    #    build their BCE targets from the discriminator output's own shape.
    #    So a mismatch with the loader's batch size is inert *today*; it is
    #    documented here, and left un-validated, precisely because adding a
    #    guard would assert a coupling that this version does not have.
    # 2. It produces no pixel-level anomaly map -- see `IMAGE_LEVEL_ONLY`.
    #    Image AUROC is computable for it; pixel AUROC/AUPRO is not.
    #
    # Values are upstream's defaults. `wadv`/`wcon`/`wenc` are the
    # adversarial/contextual/encoder loss weights from the GANomaly paper;
    # `lr`/`beta1`/`beta2` are its published Adam settings.
