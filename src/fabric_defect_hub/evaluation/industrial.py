"""Industrial-inspection `Evaluator`: under-detection rate (missed-defect
rate), over-detection rate (false-alarm rate), and — when fabric length is
known — alarms per unit length. Works across both the anomaly and detection
tasks by reducing each sample to a single positive/negative call, so the
same evaluator scores an Anomalib PatchCore run and a YOLO/Faster R-CNN run.

The threshold-selection idea (`recall_first_threshold`) is adapted from a
pattern seen in a sibling internal project's `TargetRecallThreshold`
metric: for quality inspection, missing a real defect (under-detection) is
usually far more costly than a false alarm (over-detection, which a human
just re-checks) — so instead of the F1-optimal threshold
`evaluation.anomaly` picks, this evaluator finds the *highest* threshold
that still keeps recall at or above a target (default 99%), i.e. the
fewest false alarms achievable without under-detecting more than allowed.
That's a genuinely different selection criterion from F1, not just a
relabeling of it, which is why it lives in its own evaluator rather than
being folded into `anomaly.py`.
